“Hi, can I help you?”

+ I want to know more about the truth behind Elysium. I’ve gone through initial screening and the message has been sprayed.
    “It’s about time we had a newcomer. This time it’s a young girl. You have guts at this age, I like it! I’m sure you were told that we don’t let anyone in that easily, because it puts us all at risk. I need you to do three things for me, before I let you in. The first thing is to put this poster on five spots in the city. We need to spread the word. Look for spots that people can see, but don’t get caught. Come back to me for the other two things.”
    -> DONE
