“CNiko347… Healthy brains, at least 50 years durability. This is big, real big. Forget the third thing I talked about. You’re in. You’ve helped us tremendously already. Tell me your name.”

+ My name is Alejandra Nikolas.
    “Nikolas? Alejandra Nikolas? You… you should’ve told me earlier. I guess this is fate. You see, the one who started Anti-L.A.B. is none other than Alastaire Nikolas. He mentions you all the time and talks about how he will save you. He regrets not being able to save your brother in time, but we don’t understand what he meant by that. You probably don’t remember him, but he’s your uncle and the only family you have in Elysium. We have to set up a meeting with him.”
