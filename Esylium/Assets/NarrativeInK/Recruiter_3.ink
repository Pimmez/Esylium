“Show me the document.”

+ I didn't get the document... but I took a picture of it.
    “I thought I asked you to get the document.”
    -> risky

=== risky ===
+ If I took the document, they would’ve surely noticed afterwards and with the cameras they could’ve easily tracked me down. I couldn’t take that risk.
    “Smart girl, I’ll give you that. Show me the picture then.”
    -> DONE
